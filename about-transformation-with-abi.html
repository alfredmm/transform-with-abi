                    <h2>Who in this World is <span class="highlight"> Abi</span>???</h2>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Mwingi, Kenya. After completing my 
                        Primary teaching certification, I moved to Nairobi in 2008, 
                        driven by the hope of finding a better-paying job and creating
                         a better future for myself.
                        <hr>
                        For five years, I taught in private schools across Nairobi, 
                        and eventually, after getting my Bachelor's in Education, 
                        I  transitioned into teaching the IB curriculum at an 
                        International Baccalaureate World School. That chapter 
                        shaped me in many ways, and after another five years, 
                        I felt ready to leave my comfort zone and step into the unknown. 
                        I took a leap of faith and accepted my first overseas teaching 
                        job in Japan.
                        <hr>
                        Relocating to Japan completely changed my life. As much as it 
                        was exciting, it came with a new set of challenges. Suddenly,
                         I had to balance being a full-time mother and a dedicated teacher, 
                         without the support I was used to back home, no full-time nanny, 
                         no familiar community, just me. The pressure was overwhelming at times. I started seeking comfort in food, and slowly, I lost touch with myself. I gained weight, my energy dropped, and I didn’t feel like the person I once was.</p>

                    <h3>My Transformation Journey <span class="highlight"> Started When...</span></h3>
                    <p>I woke up one day feeling drained,  my knees and back ached,
                         and I barely recognized the person in the mirror. 
                         That was my wake-up call. I knew I had to do something. 
                         I had to reclaim myself.
                         <br><br>
                        In 2021, I made a decision that changed my life!  I started 
                        my fitness journey. I hired a coach to guide me, but at first,
                         I was taken aback by the cost. At the same time, I was trying
                          to enroll in an English driving school in Japan, which was 
                          already financially demanding. I had to make a choice: 
                          either spend my summer on vacation or teach summer school 
                          and invest in my health. I chose the latter and I’ve never 
                          looked back.
                          I used every coin I earned that summer to pay for my coach. 
                            That investment changed my life. I got the results I had 
                            only dreamed of. I lost the weight, regained my energy, 
                            rebuilt my confidence, and found a new purpose burning 
                            inside me.
                            <br><br>
                            My journey didn’t stop there. Still driven by my passion
                             to grow and make a difference, I accepted a higher-paying
                              teaching job in Sudan. Unfortunately, I was only able to
                               teach for a few months before war broke out in April 2022,
                                forcing me to return to Kenya. But I refused to give up 
                                on my dream of being an international teacher. With just 
                                a laptop and internet connection, I went back into the 
                                job market and within a month, I had secured a new teaching 
                                role in the United States.

                    <p>
                            Even after all that, I knew there was still more I was meant
                             to do. Deep in my heart, I had a calling to help women 
                             transform their lives just like I did. I wanted to help 
                             them gain their confidence back, feel good in their skin,
                              and become the best versions of themselves. So, I enrolled
                               in a Health and Wellness Coaching Certification program 
                               here in the U.S. to officially become a certified coach.
                               <hr>
                            Teaching has always been my passion, and being a coach is
                             simply an extension of that. The same qualities that made me a good teacher, patience, empathy, active listening, and the ability to see someone’s potential, are the same qualities I bring into coaching.
                            Having walked the weight loss journey myself, I understand 
                            just how hard it can be to do it alone. Figuring it all out by yourself can be exhausting, confusing, and discouraging. That’s why having a coach, someone who sees you, supports you, and walks alongside you, is one of the most powerful gifts you can give yourself.
                        <br><hr>
                        Today, I proudly serve as a Body and Transformation Coach. 
                        My mission is to help women lose weight, feel amazing in their bodies, and live their lives with joy, energy, and confidence. Because every woman deserves to wake up feeling proud of who she is inside and out!
